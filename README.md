## Technical Decisions

1. **react-intersection-observer Library** was chosen for data fetching and state management due to its built-in caching and handling of async states like loading and errors.
2. **Tailwind CSS** was used for rapid styling and building a responsive UI. It allows easy customization and ensures that the application looks great on all devices.
3. The application is built using **Next.js App Router** to handle both page routing and API routes seamlessly within the same framework.

---

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. **Data Fetching**: Initially faced issues with managing product data and filters simultaneously. The solution was to use **Tanstack Query** to separate concerns and manage different states like loading, error, and success for each data request.
2. **State Management**: Handling multiple filters and synchronizing them with the displayed data was a challenge. This was solved by using **React Context API** to globally manage the filter states.
3. **Keeping the type safety** :- Handle all the types correctly from the frontend to the backend.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to build a responsive and feature-rich e-commerce admin dashboard with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The dashboard provides admins with the ability to manage products, filter them, and view detailed analytics. 

The solution is highly modular, scalable, and can be extended with additional features like user management, advanced analytics, or a more sophisticated authentication system in the future.
